    <h1>My Love,</h1>

    <p>
      Three months have passed, and every day with you feels like a gift I never knew I deserved.
      I still pause sometimes and wonder how I got so lucky to have you in my life.
      You are my calm in the chaos, my home in the storm, and a joy I never imagined so quietly steady.
    </p>

    <p>
      I see you not just in the big moments, but in the small, ordinary ones.
      The way you carry yourself with strength and independence,
      the way your kindness shows even when no one is watching.
      I see the effort you put into everything, especially the things that don’t come easily,
      and it humbles me more than you know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your confidence, your warmth, your heart
      they draw me in every day.
      Being able to call you my wife, and hearing you call me your husband,
      still feels quietly surreal, in the best way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every smile of yours, every look, every shared silence
      reminds me that what we have is real.
      I don’t take any of it lightly
      not the laughter, not the teasing, not the peaceful moments where nothing needs to be said.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want you to always feel safe with me.
      I want to be your calm, your anchor, your partner
      in ease and in difficulty, in this world and the next.
      In ShaAllah I pray for your happiness, your health,
      and for a life where we continue choosing each other,
      day after day, with patience and love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for letting me love you.
      Thank you for your patience, your trust and for choosing me.
      I promise to value you, protect you, and honor you
      not loudly, but consistently.
      You are my world, my peace, my love,
      and I choose you quietly, fully, always.
    </p>
